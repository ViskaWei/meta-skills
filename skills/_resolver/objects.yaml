# Object Registry — 91 canonical objects for cap-* IDs
#
# Rules:
#   1. cap-* IDs MUST use an object from this registry
#   2. Objects are the head-noun (what the verb acts on)
#   3. Same object can pair with different verbs (e.g., cap-intake-brief, cap-extract-brief)
#   4. kebab-case, 1-3 tokens max
#   5. No implementation details (use "results-table" not "latex-results-table")
#
# Validation: tools/validate_contracts.sh checks cap_id objects against this list
