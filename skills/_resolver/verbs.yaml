# Verb Governance — 18 canonical verbs for cap-* IDs
#
# Rules:
#   1. cap-* IDs MUST use a canonical verb (no aliases in IDs)
#   2. Aliases are for L0 input parsing only (user-facing synonyms)
#   3. Stage names (discover/verify/etc.) are NOT verbs
#   4. When adding a new verb, document its boundary vs neighbors

    definition: "Push artifacts to external registries, repos, or platforms"
    boundary: "External release; requires prior package step"
    aliases: [deploy, release, push, distribute]
    stages: [deliver]
    disambiguation: "publish = external release; package = delivery-ready bundle"
